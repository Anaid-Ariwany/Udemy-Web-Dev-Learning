# Museum of Candy Project
This project is a simple web page for a fictional candy museum, showcasing various types of candies and sweets. The page is designed using HTML and CSS, with a focus on layout, styling, and responsiveness. It utilizes the Bootstrap (version 4.5) framework to ensure the site is mobile-friendly and visually appealing across different devices.

## Features
- Nav bar links change color on hover.
- Nav bar is sticky at the top of the page on scrolling and changes background color.

    2. The sections stack vertically instead of side by side.
    3. The header text is no longer displayed.
    4. The candy icon dissapears from the text.
    5. The text is always above the images.
